## Project Progress

**Purpose:**  
Tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

---

### What Works
- [List features or components that are working.]

### What's Left to Build
- [List features or components that still need to be built.]

### Current Status
[Describe the current overall status of the project.]

### Known Issues
- The `zaino` Docker image build fails because it requires Docker BuildKit, which is not enabled by default in the Ansible `docker_image` module.

### Evolution of Project Decisions
- [Document how and why major decisions have changed over time.]

*Update this file regularly to reflect project progress and status.*
