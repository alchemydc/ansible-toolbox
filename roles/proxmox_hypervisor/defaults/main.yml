# Defaults for roles/proxmox_hypervisor
# Set to false if another role (e.g. base_server) manages Proxmox apt repositories centrally.
manage_proxmox_repos: true

# Note:
# - Do not set proxmox_distro here unless you want to force a specific suite.
#   By default, the tasks will expect `proxmox_distro` to be provided (inventory/group_vars/host_vars)
#   or determined elsewhere. Override as needed.
