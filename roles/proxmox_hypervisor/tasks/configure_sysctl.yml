# BGP EVPN and VXLAN routing require these kernel parameters:
# - rp_filter=0: EVPN uses asymmetric routing (traffic in one iface, out another).
#   Strict RPF would drop these packets. Disabled globally for all interfaces.
# - ip_forward=1: Required to route between VXLAN tunnels and physical NICs.
#   Without it, inter-VNET communication fails.
