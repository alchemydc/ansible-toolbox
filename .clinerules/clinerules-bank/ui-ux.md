# UI/UX Rules

## Styling and Accessibility

- All UI styling must respect system color scheme preferences (e.g., implement dark mode using Tailwind's `dark:` variant or equivalent in other frameworks).
- Ensure accessibility best practices are followed, including sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML where possible.
